# fp-swift

A collection of projects for those interested in functional programming paradigms executed in the Swift programming language.

To answer your first question... _No, Swift is not a purely functional language._

The goal here is learning more about functional programming paradigms, techniques, and their applications within the domains of Swift, Kotlin and iOS/Android development.

## Curriculum (in no particular order):

- Protocol Witnesses
- Modeling state within the context of iOS applications
- Partial functions
- Functors, Monads, and Monoids - oh my!
- Recursion
- Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)
- Quick peak into category theory
- Beyond...
